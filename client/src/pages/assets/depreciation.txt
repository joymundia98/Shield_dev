This table is showing information about the **depreciation** of assets over the **fiscal year 2025**. Depreciation is the process of reducing the value of an asset over time, usually because it’s getting older or losing value as it gets used.

Here's a breakdown of what each column means in simpler terms:

1. **depreciation_id**: This is just a unique number used to identify each depreciation record.
2. **asset_id**: This is the ID of the asset (like a machine, car, or computer) being depreciated.
3. **fiscal_year**: The year in which this depreciation is happening, in this case, **2025**.
4. **opening_value**: The value of the asset at the **start** of the year before any depreciation is applied.
5. **depreciation_rate**: The percentage of the asset’s value that will be depreciated each year. In this case, it’s **20%** for each asset.
6. **depreciation_amount**: This is the actual amount of value the asset will lose that year due to depreciation. It’s calculated by multiplying the **opening value** by the **depreciation rate** (for example, 20% of $1200 = $240).
7. **closing_value**: This is the value of the asset at the **end** of the year after depreciation has been applied. It’s the opening value minus the depreciation amount (for example, $1200 - $240 = $960).
8. **created_at**: The date and time when this depreciation record was created.
9. **useful_life**: This could refer to how many years the asset is expected to last before it’s no longer useful, although this column doesn't seem to have values in the data you provided.

### Example Explanation:

* For **asset 9** (the one with an opening value of $28,000):

  * The asset started with a value of **$28,000**.
  * It lost **20%** of its value, so the **depreciation amount** is **$5,600** (20% of $28,000).
  * The **closing value** of the asset at the end of the year is **$22,400** ($28,000 - $5,600).

So, in simpler terms, this table tracks how much value each asset loses over the course of a year due to wear and tear or aging. Each asset's value is reduced by 20%, and the table shows what the asset's value was at the start and end of the year.

Sure! Here’s a simplified version of the column names with easier-to-understand terms:

1. **Depreciation ID** → **Record ID**
2. **Asset ID** → **Asset Number**
3. **Fiscal Year** → **Year**
4. **Opening Value** → **Starting Value**
5. **Depreciation Rate** → **Percent Depreciated**
6. **Depreciation Amount** → **Value Lost**
7. **Closing Value** → **End Value**
8. **Created At** → **Record Date**
9. **Useful Life** → **Expected Lifespan** (This would show how long the asset is expected to last, though the values are missing in this example)

So your table with simpler column names would look like this:

| Record ID | Asset Number | Year | Starting Value | Percent Depreciated | Value Lost | End Value | Record Date            | Expected Lifespan |
| --------- | ------------ | ---- | -------------- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
