In Zambia, the payroll system is governed by various legal requirements and components that need to be factored in to ensure accurate processing of employee wages and adherence to the country's tax and employment regulations. Here’s an overview of what should be factored in the Zambian payroll:

### 1. **Basic Salary**

* This is the fixed amount an employee is entitled to for the work performed during the payroll period (monthly, bi-weekly, etc.). It is the starting point for calculating all deductions and benefits.

### 2. **Allowances**

* **Housing Allowance**: If provided by the employer, this is meant to help employees cover accommodation costs. It is usually taxed.
* **Transport Allowance**: Provided to employees to cover travel expenses related to their work.
* **Medical Allowance**: If employees are provided with medical allowances or insurance, it needs to be included.
* **Other Allowances**: Special allowances for lunch, utilities, or any additional work-related expenses may also be included.

### 3. **Overtime**

* Overtime is paid when an employee works beyond the regular hours stipulated in their contract. Overtime pay is often calculated at a higher rate (e.g., 1.5 times the normal hourly rate).

### 4. **Bonuses**

* Any annual, quarterly, or performance-based bonuses need to be included. Bonuses may be taxed depending on the amount.

### 5. **Deductions**

Various deductions are required by law in Zambia:

* **Pay As You Earn (PAYE)**: This is the primary tax deducted from an employee’s salary. The rates for PAYE are progressive based on income. The tax bands are updated periodically, so it's important to be aware of the latest changes.

  Example PAYE bands (as of 2023, but may change):

  * 0% on income up to ZMW 4,000 per month
  * 25% on income between ZMW 4,001 and ZMW 10,000
  * 30% on income over ZMW 10,000

* **Social Security Contributions**:

  * **Zambia National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA)**: Employees and employers are required to contribute to NAPSA for pensions and social security benefits. The contribution rate is typically around 5% for the employee and 5% for the employer, but this can vary depending on the sector.
  * NAPSA covers retirement benefits, pensions, death benefits, and other social security benefits.

* **Health Insurance (if applicable)**: Some employers offer health insurance plans for employees. Premiums can be deducted from payroll if this is a part of the compensation package.

* **Union Dues (if applicable)**: If the employee is a member of a trade union, monthly union dues may need to be deducted.

* **Loan Deductions**: If an employee has taken out a loan through their employer (e.g., a staff loan), the repayment amount needs to be deducted from their salary.

* **Other Deductions**: This could include court-ordered deductions, garnishments, or other legally required deductions.

### 6. **Taxable Benefits**

Any non-cash benefits provided to employees by the employer, such as company vehicles, housing, or other perks, may be taxable and must be included in the payroll calculations.

### 7. **Gratuity/Severance Pay (if applicable)**

* This is a form of compensation given to employees at the end of a contract or employment. It typically applies when an employee is leaving after several years of service and is not usually paid out monthly but should be included in final settlements.

### 8. **Employee Contributions to Other Benefits**

Some companies may also have contributions to additional schemes or benefits such as:

* **Provident Fund Contributions**
* **Group Life Insurance**
* **Retirement Savings Fund**

### 9. **Leave**

* Employees are entitled to annual leave (at least 24 working days per year) and sick leave. While this is not a direct payroll cost, you must ensure that it is accurately tracked and provisioned for in the case of payment during leave periods.

### 10. **Other Statutory Contributions**

* Employers must also factor in their own contributions to government-mandated programs such as **Workers' Compensation Fund (WCIF)**, which covers employees in the event of work-related injuries or death. This is usually paid by the employer.

### Steps to Process Zambian Payroll:

1. **Calculate Gross Salary**: Sum up the basic salary, allowances, bonuses, and overtime.
2. **Apply PAYE**: Deduct the applicable PAYE tax based on the income bands.
3. **Social Security Contributions**: Deduct both employee and employer contributions to NAPSA (if applicable).
4. **Other Deductions**: Include union dues, loan deductions, health insurance, and other applicable deductions.
5. **Calculate Net Salary**: After all deductions, the amount left is the employee's net salary.
6. **Issue Payslip**: Provide the employee with a payslip detailing their gross salary, deductions, and net pay.

### Considerations:

* Always ensure compliance with the latest tax laws and minimum wage regulations.
* Keep up to date with changes in the PAYE bands, NAPSA contribution rates, and other legal requirements.
* If payroll includes expatriates, ensure that all applicable tax treaties and exemptions are taken into account.
